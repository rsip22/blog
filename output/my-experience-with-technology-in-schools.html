		<p>I got engaged with Free Software about two and a half years ago, when I started working in a school.</p>
<p>I know a bit about the reality of working with very limited resources, specially when talking about tech.</p>
<p>During the first semester of 2017, I did an internship in a municipal school here in Porto Alegre (that is a public school that is taken care by the city government, instead of the state government). It was an exceptional school in terms of equipment, they had a computer lab with more than 20 computers and almost as many notebooks to be used by teachers and students. All the computers in the lab ran <a href="http://linuxeducacional.c3sl.ufpr.br/">Linux Educacional</a> (which, I admit, was the reason I chose this particular school), a Linux distribution based on Ubuntu, funded by the Brazilian federal government to be used in public schools' computers.</p>
<p>I have developed https://EmAula.xyz, which is a Django application to help teachers to create lesson plans and share them with their students. I made it in Django because I wanted to learn more about the framework, beyond the Django Girls tutorial which I already knew from beginning to end and because I felt confidant enough so I could help my collegue with it.
The things I remember learning the most from this project:
- Working with branches on Git (because I had to teach someone how to do it)
- Design the database relationships and how to make it work between different Django apps
- Setting up and using PostgreSQL as database
- Environment settings, so we didn't have to publicize the app's secret key and didn't have to change the database config every time
- How sometimes the OS image wasn't very much up to date on cloud providers</p>
