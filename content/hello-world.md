### About me
Hello, world! For those who are meeting me for the first time, I am a 31 years old History teacher from Porto Alegre, Brazil.

Some people might know me from the Python community, because I have been leading [PyLadies Porto Alegre](https://pyladiespoa.pythonanywhere.com) and helping organize [Django Girls workshops](https://blog.djangogirls.org/post/166221911403/django-girls-rio-grande-do-sul) in my state since 2016. If you don't, that's okay. Nice to meet you!

I have been wanting to get into an internship program ever since I learned about [Rails Girls Summer of Code](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/). I heard about [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) as well, but I didn't feel like I knew enough to try and get into these programs... until I found [Outreachy](https://outreachy.org). From their site:

> Outreachy is an organization that provides three-month internships for people from groups traditionally underrepresented in tech. Interns work remotely with mentors from Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) communities on projects ranging from programming, user experience, documentation, illustration and graphical design, to data science.

There were many good projects to choose from on this round, a lot of them with few requirements - usually requirements that I believed I could fullfill, such as HTML, CSS, Python and Django.

Since you're reading this, I'm going to be honest. I am not an expert in any of those. Coding is hard. Coding is hard to learn, it takes a lot of studying and a lot of practice. Even though I have been messing around computers pretty much since I was a kid, because I was a girl lucky enough to have a father who owned a computer store, I hadn't began learning how to program until the beginning of 2016 - and I am still learning.

I think I became such an autodidact because I had to. I had to get any and all information from my surroundings and turn into knowledge that I could use. In a time where I could only get cool new games through a CD-ROM and the computer I was allowed to use didn't have a CD-ROM drive, I had to learn how to open a computer cabinet and connect/disconnect hardware properly, so I could use my brother's CD-ROM drive on the computer I was allowed to, to install the games without anyone knowing about. When I couldn't connect to the internet because the computer I was allowed to use didn't have a modem, I had to learn about networks to figure out how to do it from my brother's computer on the LAN (local network).

I would read books and any tech magazines I could get my hands into. I learned how to create HTML sites back in 2003 by looking at the source code from pages I had saved to read offline in one of the very, very few times I was allowed to access the internet and browse the web. Of course, the site I created back then never saw the light of the day, because I didn't have internet access at home.

How come it is that, 14 years later, only now I am trying to get into tech?

Because when I finished high school I was still a minor and my family didn't allow me to go to Vocational School and take an IT course.

I ended up going to do... teacher training in History as an undergrad course.

A lot happened since then. I took the exam to become a public school teacher, but more than two years had passed without being called to work. I spent 3 years in odd-jobs that were barely enough to pay rent. Since the IT is the new thing and all jobs are in IT, finally, *finally* it seemed okay for me to take that Vocational School training - and I did.

I gotta say, I thought I while I studied, I would be able to get some sort of internship to help with my learning. I had seen it happened easily. Of course, with white males that I knew. It took a whole year of searching, trying and interviewing for me to get an internship related to the field. And, in that very same week, I was hired as a public school teacher.

There is a lot... actually, there is so much more to this story, but I think I have told enough for now. Enough to know where I came from and who I am, as of now. I hope you stick around. I am bound to write here every two weeks, so I guess I will see you then! o/
